## DMRG Result
J1 = 1, J2 = 0.0, N = 20, E = -8.9044
J1 = 1, J2 = 0.2, N = 20, E = -8.2029
J1 = 1, J2 = 0.5, N = 20, E = -7.5

## To Do
* $N = 20, J_2 = 0, 0.2$
* - $N = 10$, show $\psi$ and $\psi_{exact}$
* prove conve optimization if signs known
* calculate AFM structure factor.
* - optimize SA solver using sparsity
* - skip sampling
* - formula: gradient descent, the $r-\theta$ version
* formula: stochastic reconfiguration, the $r-\theta$ version
<<<<<<< HEAD
* VMC with 5% chance flip a configuration
* train $\theta$ with amplitude fixed, plot it.
* translational invariance
* Stochastic reconfiguration for $r-\theta$ network
